For instance, a large ARPA raid in Southern Utah found that the looters were using publicly available University of Utah monographs to find and loot sites. Making more of this information (specifically site location) available will have real effects. However, there is a lot of room to discuss artifact analyses, summary & conclusions, syntheses, etc., that would be of interest to the public but not expose sites to further risk. 

In the case of data standards, I always chafe at those requirements as they are oftentimes written by eastern states and bureaucracies that do not manage lands or cultural resources, and don't understand the nature of the American West or the extreme variety that does exist out there. I would worry to, as is often the case with national initiatives, that the individuality of the state in question is overlooked for the benefit of a standardized system. In archaeology it seems ""one size"" does not fit all. Further, if there is adoption of the data standards there would be a ripple effect to the land managing agencies, SHPOs, THPOs, and consultants that would cost significant money to standardize. This comes in the face of growing demands and shrinking budgets. If there is a future data standard, it would need to be affordable, not require alterations of existing centralized data centers, and recognize the variability of the archaeology in each state and/or region.

Whatever source of funding supports or compelled the research should support the long term curation of digital archaeological data.  There should be no financial barriers to access data (user-supported models)","Site Location, Burial Data","Artifact Analysis, Architectural Details","Sensitive information can and should be preserved in online repositories for digital data that include metadata that generally describe the information.  The metadata should be searchable and easily discoverable, but the sensitive content (e.g. digital files with site location information) should be protected from public access.  Both Open Context and tDAR support this type of access and discovery.  ",,No,"The current state of archaeological data curation makes synthetic research or even thorough background research unnecessarily challenging.  While land managers have a responsibility to protect archaeological site location information and some other types of sensitive information, they should not prevent easy discovery of the existence of archaeological research data --in fact they should strive to facilitate it.  Archaeologists working during the early period of compliance archaeology in the United States, during which large amounts of data were collected, are beginning to retire and die off.  Their knowledge about where extremely unique paper and digital collections are stored may leave with them.  Those data are irreplaceable and as a discipline it is imperative that we properly care for them so that future research endeavors and land management decisions can be made with the full wealth of available data.    

When services like tDAR and Open Context exist, agencies and academic researchers should endeavor to support their use rather than develop their own internal databases (that are likely to silo data off and prevent it from being discovered and reused) .  tDAR and Open Context aren't just data clearinghouses, but they also focus on preservation, meaning that the data they care for are under their care for posterity.  They work closely with archival communities to ensure that digital data are forward migrated for future use. 

I understand the great responsibility that agencies have to protect the information they manage, and i think the repositories you've mentioned strive to do the same.  It is my understanding that both tDAR and Open Context allow the ""owner"" of the digital content to remain the gatekeeper, so no change from keeping the information on local servers or in paper in the office.  What does change is other researchers' and the interested public's ability to discover that this content exists in the first place.    "

The trick to standardization is creating them flexible enough to handle the complex subjects/objects related to human behavior but keep them direct and useful. tDAR and other services are a step in the right direction. 

If databases were standardized and made more familiar to archaeologists, they could help professionals further research, but also facilitate a relationship with the public or non-archaeologists. Databases can help foster appreciation for the contributions archaeological studies can make to many facets of everyday life and our understanding of humanity. "
