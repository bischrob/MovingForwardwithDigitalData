"Sensitive information can and should be preserved in online repositories for digital data that include metadata that generally describe the information.  The metadata should be searchable and easily discoverable, but the sensitive content (e.g. digital files with site location information) should be protected from public access.  Both Open Context and tDAR support this type of access and discovery.  ",,,,,,
